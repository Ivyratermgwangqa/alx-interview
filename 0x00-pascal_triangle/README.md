# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it was known to mathematicians in several cultures before his time.

In this project, you will implement a function in Python to generate Pascal's Triangle of a given size. The function will return a list of lists, where each list represents a row in the triangle.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory to get started.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>/0x00-pascal_triangle
```

### Generate Pascal's Triangle
To generate Pascal's Triangle with a specified number of rows, run the following command:

```bash
python3 0-main.py
```

### Example Output
Here's an example output for Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows:

```bash
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```

## Project Structure
- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: Python script containing the `pascal_triangle` function to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- `0-main.py`: Script to test the Pascal's Triangle function.
- `README.md`: This file.
